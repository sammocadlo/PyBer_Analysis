# PyBer Analysis
Analysis was done on PyBer ridesharing data to explore and visualize access to rideshare services and determine affordability for any areas that are underserved.

# Results
This analysis examined the relationships between the ridesharing data, such as the amount of drivers and riders as well as the fares collected, in three different city types - urban, suburban, and rural. Beginning with the use of rideshare services by city type, urban cities have by far the largest percentage of drivers and riders as compared to suburban and rural cities.

Urban cities overall also show the highest percentage of total fares collected by the PyBer ridesharing services, over 50% of total fares are collected from the service in urban areas.

While urban cities show the highest percentages overall for riders, drivers, and total fare collected, the average total fares tell a different story. Though urban areas collect the largest percentage chunk of fares for PyBer, the average fare amount per ride is around $24. Conversly, the average fare per ride in rural cities is on average over $10 higher - coming in at around $36. The highest fares paid are also incurred in rural cities, with some fares nearing $60.

Rural areas also show a much lower amount of drivers available, calling into question the accessability of PyBer ridesharing services in rural areas.

Surburban areas, as shown in the figures above, also show some of the same trends as the rural areas but to a lesser degree. The rides are typically more expensive with less drivers available than urban areas. It may be that the demand for the service is simply hgiher in urban areas, leading to lower rates per ride and more available drivers, or it could be that the services in suburban and rural areas should be expanded to allow for more accessability to the service as a more readily afforable service with more drivers availble.

Our final figure from this analysis shows the trends of total fares over the first 4 months of 209 between the urban, suburban, and rural areas serviced by PyBer. From this line chart, it is seen that the trends of total fare are similar between all three city types, with each seeing a spike in late February.

# Summary

Based on the analysis of the ridesharing data for the PyBer rideshraing service, I would make three reccomendations to address the disparity between city types. 
  - The lower number of drivers and higher average fares in rural areas should be considered as an area for growth. Perhaps expanding services in rural areas could lead to a more affordable service, and more revenue from these areas. 
  - The higher fares in rural areas could also be from longer trips - further analysis should be done on this area.
  - Drivers in urban cities are earning less on average per ride than in other areas. This could discourage potential drivers from working with PyBer. Further analysis could be done comparing rates with competitor companies.
